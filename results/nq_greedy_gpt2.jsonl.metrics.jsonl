A series of close losses hampered the Tigers throughout the middle of the season, including a 5-point loss to the Western Bulldogs, 2-point loss to Fremantle, and a 3-point loss to the Giants. Richmond ended the season strongly with convincing victories over Fremantle and St Kilda in the final two rounds, elevating the club to 3rd on the ladder. Richmond's first final of the season against the Cats at the MCG attracted a record qualifying final crowd of 95,028; the Tigers won by 51 points. Having advanced to the first preliminary finals for the first time since 2001, Richmond defeated Greater Western Sydney by 36 points in front of a crowd of 94,258 to progress to the Grand Final against Adelaide, their first Grand Final appearance since 1982. The attendance was 100,021, the largest crowd to a grand final since 1986. The Crows led at quarter time and led by as many as 13, but the Tigers took over the game as it progressed and scored seven straight goals at one point. They eventually would win by 48 points – 16.12 (108) to Adelaide's 8.12 (60) – to end their 37-year flag drought.[22] Dustin Martin also became the first player to win a Premiership medal, the Brownlow Medal and the Norm Smith Medal in the same season, while Damien Hardwick was named AFL Coaches Association Coach of the Year.

While it had French settlers, Mardi Gras and other customs were celebrated with more fanfare given its new status.[3] In 1723, the capital of French Louisiana was moved to New Orleans, founded in 1718.[5] With the growth of New Orleans as a city and the creolization of different cultures, the varied celebration of Mardi Gras became the event most strongly associated with the city.[3] In more recent times, several U.S. cities without a French Catholic heritage have instituted the celebration of Mardi Gras, which sometimes emerged as grassroots movements to help accompany single people to celebrate something in late Winter which is often dominated by the commercialized and couple-centric Valentine's Day, and as a result it has been co-opted as the single people's late Winter holiday.", "bleu": 0.03852781609703091, "meteor": 0.094045382838215, "perplexity": 1.1733458452668932, "rep_w": 0.8461538461538461, "rep_n_1": 0.8461538461538461, "rep_n_2": 0.84375, "rep_n_3": 0.8412698412698413, "rep_n_4": 0.8387096774193549, "rep_n_5": 0.8360655737704918, "rep_r": 0.9692307692307692}

The peasant and rural society is represented by the family of Hori Mahato and his family members which includes Dhania (wife), Rupa and Sona (daughters), Gobar (son), Jhunia (daughter-In-law). The story starts from a point where Hori has a deep desire of having a cow as other millions of poor peasants. He purchased, on debt of Rs. 80, a cow from Bhola, a cowherd. Hori tried to cheat his brothers for 10 rupees. This in turn led to a fight between his wife and his younger brother, Heera's wife. Jealous of Hori, his younger brother Heera poisoned the cow and ran away because of the fear of police action. When the police came inquiring the death of the cow, Hori took a loan and paid the bribe to the police and was able to clear off his younger brother's name. Jhunia, the daughter of Bhola, was a widow and eloped with Gobar after she got pregnant by him. Because of the fear of the action from villagers Gobar also ran away to the town. Hori and Dhania were unable to throw a girl carrying their son's child and gave her protection and accepted her as their daughter-in-law. The village Panchayat fines Hori as his wife tackles the personal attack of the Pandit on them for sheltering Jhunia. Hori again is compelled to take a loan and pay the penalty. Hori is in huge debt from local money lenders and eventually married off his daughter Rupa for mere 200 rupees to save his ancestral land from being auctioned because of his inability to pay land tax. But his determination to pay those 200 rupees and to have a cow to provide milk to his grand son, leads to Hori's death because of excessive work. When he is about to die, his wife Dhania took out all the money she had (1.25 Rupees) and made Hori pay the priest on behalf of (Godan) (cow donation). This eventually fulfils the traditional dream of Hori but still his desire to pay back the rupees 200 to his son- in-law and to have a cow to feed the milk to his grandson remain unfulfilled. Hori is shown as a typical poor peasant who is the victim of circumstances and possess all the deficiencies of common man but despite all this, he stands by his honesty, duties and judgement when time requires.

The first archaeological evidence and credible records showing a community large enough to maintain churches and bishops dates to the 3rd and 4th centuries, but it started from a small base: the British delegation to the 353 Council of Rimini had to beg for financial assistance from its fellows in order to return home.[8] The Romano-British population seem to have been mostly Christian by the Sub-Roman period, although the Great Conspiracy in the 360s and increased raiding around the time of the Roman withdrawal from Britain saw many enslaved. The Saxon invasions of Britain destroyed most of the formal church as they progressed, replacing it with a form of Germanic polytheism. There seems to have been a lull traditionally attributed to the Battle of Badon but, following the arrival of Justinian's Plague around 547, the expansion resumed.

Below the lithosphere the upper mantle becomes notably more plastic. In some regions below the lithosphere, the seismic shear velocity is reduced; this so-called low-velocity zone (LVZ) extends down to a depth of several hundred km. Inge Lehmann discovered a seismic discontinuity at about 220 km (140 mi) depth;[28] although this discontinuity has been found in other studies, it is not known whether the discontinuity is ubiquitous. The transition zone is an area of great complexity; it physically separates the upper and lower mantle.[26] Very little is known about the lower mantle apart from that it appears to be relatively seismically homogeneous. The D\" layer at the core–mantle boundary separates the mantle from the core.[15][24] In 2015, research using gravitational data from GRACE satellites and the long wavelength nonhydrostatic geoid indicated viscosity[29] increases by a factor of ten to 150 about 1,000 kilometres (620 mi) below earth's surface; separate research also indicates sinking tectonic plates stall at this depth, leading Robert van der Hilst to speculate \"In term's of structure and dynamics, 1,000 kilometers could be more important\" (than the currently accepted 660 km depth upper—lower division).[30] The lower mantle also contains some discontinueous zones, called \"thermochemical piles\" which have been interpreted as either thermally differentiated, upwellings bringing warmer material towards the surface, or as chemically differentiated material.[31] A principal source of the heat that drives plate tectonics is the radioactive decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium in Earth’s crust and mantle.[32]", "bleu": 0.8110468938054591, "meteor": 0.09519867549668873, "perplexity": 1.2102425063210618, "rep_w": 0.65, "rep_n_1": 0.9285714285714286, "rep_n_2": 0.8920863309352518, "rep_n_3": 0.8695652173913043, "rep_n_4": 0.8540145985401459, "rep_n_5": 0.8455882352941176, "rep_r": 0.9857142857142858}

Derek explains that Mark had an affair with his wife, Addison (Kate Walsh) while they were living in New York. Mark travels to Seattle, intent on convincing Addison to return with him, but his offer is rejected and Derek declines to renew their friendship. Mark returns during season three at Addison's drunken behest, but she again rejects him once sober. Undeterred, Mark sells his successful private practice (which he previously shared with Derek) and takes over the plastics program at Seattle Grace Hospital. During Meredith's morphine rampage, Mark finds out about his nickname McSteamy which was given to him by her during his first trip to Seattle back when he attempted to get Addison back and earn Derek's friendship back. It is later revealed that Mark has at some point slept with all of Derek's sisters. Mark has a brief fling with Addison's friend, orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), and develops a friendship with Derek's girlfriend, intern Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo). It is revealed that after Derek left New York, Mark and Addison continued their relationship for two months, during which she conceived and aborted his child. Just weeks after moving to Seattle he quickly observes that Derek's true love was Meredith and tries to convince Addison that her marriage with Derek was over. Mark enters into a sixty-day abstinence pact with Addison, agreeing that if they can remain celibate for that time, Addison will give their relationship another chance.

Stan is Francine's husband and Hayley and Steve's father. Hayley may or may not be Stan's biological daughter since Francine revealed to have cheated on Stan at a bachelorette party in the episode \"The Kidney Stays in the Picture\",[2] but Stan regards Hayley as his daughter.[2] As the Smith family breadwinner, Stan is a CIA agent. Early on in the series, Stan was exaggeratedly patriotic and Conservative.[3] His character, however, has progressed over the course of the series from the ultra right-wing it had been. All the same however, Stan has proven to be drastic and extreme in numerous other ways beyond politics.[4] He is often shown rashly taking extreme measures in ways that are conspicuously destructive, disastrous, and life-threatening to others.[3] Making his extreme-measure taking worse, Stan is utterly inconsiderate and insensitive, thus he does not stop to think of how others are negatively impacted, nor does he care. As examples of this: in the episode \"Dope & Faith\" when Stan found out one of his friends was an atheist, he tried getting him to pray by blowing up his home, spreading the bird flu at his restaurant, brainwashing his wife into thinking she was a lesbian, and taking his kids away; in the episode \"I Can't Stan You,\" Stan evicted his entire neighborhood and his own family just for overhearing some of his neighbors gossiping about him behind his back; in the episode \"Four Little Words,\" Stan framed his wife as a murderer all so as not to hear her say the words \"I told you so\"; etc. Not a stranger to going to any and all lengths to achieve his desired ends—even to the point of shamelessly harming others—Stan is characterized as very dog-eat-dog. Aside from his thoughtlessly drastic and endangering behaviors, he has an endearing and sensitive side as well. It has been revealed that he very much desires fatherly love and attention but has always lacked this.

He is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 150 million records worldwide.[2] Born in Hoboken, New Jersey, to Italian immigrants, Sinatra began his musical career in the swing era with bandleaders Harry James and Tommy Dorsey. Sinatra found success as a solo artist after he signed with Columbia Records in 1943, becoming the idol of the \"bobby soxers\". He released his debut album, The Voice of Frank Sinatra, in 1946. Sinatra's professional career had stalled by the early 1950s, and he turned to Las Vegas, where he became one of its best known performers as part of the Rat Pack. His career was reborn in 1953 with the success of From Here to Eternity, with his performance subsequently winning an Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Sinatra released several critically lauded albums, including In the Wee Small Hours (1955), Songs for Swingin' Lovers!

Jacques Cartier and his crew spent a harsh winter near Stadacona during his second voyage in 1535.[1] The word \"Kebec\" is an Algonquin word meaning \"where the river narrows.\"[2] By the time Champlain came to this site, the Iroquois population had disappeared and been replaced by Innu and Algonquins. Champlain and his crew built a wooden fort which they called \"l'habitation\" within only a few days of their arrival.[3] This early fort and trading post exists today as a historic site in Old Quebec. Quebec City's maritime position and the presence of cliffs overlooking the St. Lawrence River made it an important location for economic exchanges between the Amerindians and the French[4] In 1620, Champlain built Fort Saint-Louis on the top of Cape Diamond, near the present location of the Chateau Frontenac in the Upper Town.[4] Quebec City's 400th anniversary was celebrated in 2008 and it is the oldest city in North America that has a French-speaking community.[5]", "bleu": 0.43376200304440493, "meteor": 0.08940397350993376, "perplexity": 2.5735168637937704, "rep_w": 0.14285714285714285, "rep_n_1": 0.6734693877551021, "rep_n_2": 0.5360824742268041, "rep_n_3": 0.47916666666666663, "rep_n_4": 0.4526315789473684, "rep_n_5": 0.42553191489361697, "rep_r": 0.9387755102040817}

This ancient drainage system was destroyed by the first major glacier in the area, while it deepened and enlarged the lowland areas, allowing water to settle and form a lake.

The first 3D TV was produced in 1935, and stereoscopic 3D still cameras for personal use had already become fairly common by the Second World War. Many 3D movies were produced for theatrical release in the US during the 1950s just when television started to become popular. The first such movie was Bwana Devil from United Artists that could be seen all across the US in 1952. One year later, in 1953, came the 3D movie House of Wax which also featured stereophonic sound. Alfred Hitchcock produced his film Dial M for Murder in 3D, but for the purpose of maximizing profits the movie was released in 2D because not all cinemas were able to display 3D films. In 1946 the Soviet Union also developed 3D films, with Robinzon Kruzo being its first full-length 3D movie.[5] People were excited to view the 3D movies, but were put off by their poor quality. Because of this, their popularity declined quickly. There was another attempt in the 1970s and 80s to make 3D movies more mainstream with the releases of Friday the 13th Part III (1982) and Jaws 3-D (1983).[6] 3D showings became more popular throughout the 2000s, culminating in the success of 3D presentations of Avatar in December 2009 and January 2010.[7]", "bleu": 0.4377376075832953, "meteor": 0.08873596522998914, "perplexity": 1.5324088320590512, "rep_w": 0.3140495867768595, "rep_n_1": 0.859504132231405, "rep_n_2": 0.8333333333333334, "rep_n_3": 0.8151260504201681, "rep_n_4": 0.8135593220338984, "rep_n_5": 0.811965811965812, "rep_r": 0.9834710743801653}

Despite this and Harry's angry questions, Dumbledore avers his trust in Snape. Returning to Hogwarts after retrieving Voldemort's Horcrux, Harry and Dumbledore alight atop the school's astronomy tower. Gravely weakened by the horcrux's protective potion, Dumbledore tells Harry he must fetch Snape, but before Harry can leave, Draco suddenly arrives, intending to carry out Voldemort's order to assassinate Dumbledore, closely followed by other Death Eaters (followers of Voldemort), and Snape. Snape interrupts the planned murder, killing the headmaster himself.[36] Harry, who is paralysed under his invisibility cloak by Dumbledore for his own protection, witnesses the kill, and is released upon Dumbledore's death. Enraged, he pursues Snape, Draco, and the Death Eaters as they flee the castle. Snape easily blocks Harry's spells and jeeringly points out Harry's mistakes, but never strikes back. During the confrontation, Snape reveals himself as the eponymous \"Half-Blood Prince\" (being the half-blood son of Muggle Tobias Snape and pure-blood Eileen Prince). Snape passes through the school gates and Disapparates with Draco in tow at the book's end.[37] The full relationship between Dumbledore and Snape and the reason for Snape's actions remain unknown until the final book.

Intrigued with the rich culture of Polynesia, he felt it would be a suitable subject for an animated film. Shortly thereafter, Musker and Clements wrote a treatment and pitched it to John Lasseter, who recommended that both of them should go on research trips.[8][9] Accordingly, in 2012, Clements and Musker went on research trips to Fiji, Samoa, and Tahiti to meet the people of the South Pacific Ocean and learn about their culture.[10] At first, they had planned to make the film entirely about Maui, but their initial research trips inspired Clements to pitch a new idea focused on the young daughter of a chief.[11] They were fascinated to learn during their research that the people of Polynesia abruptly stopped making long-distance voyages about three thousand years ago, then resumed voyaging again a thousand years later, and no one really knows why. They set the film at the end of that era, about two thousand years ago, on a fictional island in the central Pacific Ocean, which drew inspiration from elements of the real-life island nations of Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga.[12]", "bleu": 0.17146958407242416, "meteor": 0.0573018991486575, "perplexity": 1.282569891937528, "rep_w": 0.937984496124031, "rep_n_1": 0.937984496124031, "rep_n_2": 0.9375, "rep_n_3": 0.937007874015748, "rep_n_4": 0.9365079365079365, "rep_n_5": 0.9359999999999999, "rep_r": 0.9922480620155039}

After recording several versions with other producers, Sheeran eventually solicited help from Jeff Bhasker; the collaboration generated a version that Bhasker further enhanced for months. The ballad derives its music primarily from an acoustic guitar, piano and programmed drums. With visually descriptive lyrics, it discusses a long-distance relationship inspired by Sheeran's own experience of being away from his then-girlfriend while he was on tour.[disambiguation needed]", "bleu": 0.5081556234776793, "meteor": 0.05656108597285068, "perplexity": 1.271315858105782, "rep_w": 0.9304347826086956, "rep_n_1": 0.9304347826086956, "rep_n_2": 0.9298245614035088, "rep_n_3": 0.9292035398230089, "rep_n_4": 0.9285714285714286, "rep_n_5": 0.9279279279279279, "rep_r": 0.991304347826087}

Ralph Baer's initial design had called for a huge row of switches that would allow players to turn on and off certain components of the console (the Odyssey lacked a CPU) to create slightly different games like tennis, volleyball, hockey, and chase. Magnavox replaced the switch design with separate cartridges for each game.
